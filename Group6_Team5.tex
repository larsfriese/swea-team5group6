				The Use Case Diagram describes the different connection and actions the user can do within the smartwatch. For example, 
				the user is able to pay with the smartwatch. After it reads the smartwatch in the card reader it verifies the card and 
				either complete the transaction or cancel the transaction. If the transaction completes the user gets a receipt or an 
				email which confirms the payment. In addition the user is able to manage his bank accounts inside the smartwatch application.

			\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
				The Activity Diagram describes the process of actions. For example the user holds his smartwatch with the digital card
				to a card reader and the card reader verifies if the card exists or does not. If the card doesn't exists it notifies
				the user that the card is invalid. Else we proceed to the bank account and the user should enter the password. If the 
				password is wrong it requests to enter the password again. After 3 tries it should automatically block the user. Else the 
				cash has been successfully transfered and the user can complete the transaction.

				The Class Diagram shows the interactions and relationships to each single process. For example, the User is
				able to create an account and register himself. Then it has a directional association to the proceed Data. Thats
				where the card is being checked, wheither it exists or not. If it exists we simply go to the bank account and check 
				for the password and get the receipt that the transaction was sucessful. If there is a case when the password is 
				incorrect we simply ask the user to retry. If the retries all failed or the user decides to pay with a different 
				payment method we need to stop the process.

				Inside the Sequence Diagram we have a Main which opens the smartwatch. Then the user checks the digital card with the 
				card reader if it exists or not. If it doesn't we simply stop the program. Else we can just check if its vaild and request the 
				user to enter the password. If the password is correct we get the receipt and the transaction message. If we might occur to incorrect 
				password we have 2 more retries and if those 2 failed aswell we stop the program if not we can get the receipt and the transaction
