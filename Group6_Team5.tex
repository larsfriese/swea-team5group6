\end{enumerate}

\section*{Content of Meeting}
We used the First Meeting to discuss the foundation of our final Report. The first question was which Software are we choosing for the Diagrams to ensure a clean and consistent report. PlantUML and Magic Draw were the Software’s in discussion and after an overview of PlantUMLl by Marc we decided that Magic draw would be the best and safest option for all of us since the majority of the group already used Magic Draw or knew the Basics. Our Second To Do was to determine the other 14 requirements. After a Brainstorming session we chose the 14 requirements and allocated them between the Members.

    \item Presenting our results
    \item Choosing Business Value 
    \item Feedback round
    \item Setting Tasks for Meeting 3
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Content of Meeting}
Our Group used the second meeting to check how far everybody is with their Diagrams. Everyone shortly presented their already or almost finished Use Cases and the Diagrams to discuss theme within the group and to get short feedback. It was important for us to do that in the second meeting to have the possibility to optimize our other Diagrams for the best results and to avoid difficulties like too similar requirements. Furthermore, we choose the Business Values of each requirement together and it really helped us to have different opinions and takes to choose the best ones.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Content of Meeting}
In our third Meeting we have once more discussed our documentation, we simply try to find a suitable format with the corresponding styling, so it looks uniform. We also distributed the time and the content which we want to present in our presentation, so that we mostly cover all our work. Finally, we had a few backlog items, which we defined in GitHub in a Project Manager table. We have discussed those like, “Intro Pitch”, or “Tabular List of all backlog items” and assigned those tasks to the group members.

				In this class diagramm, the gesture controller keeps track of all the gesture objects there are.
				Whenever a motion is detected, it will cycle thorugh all the gesture objects it has, and calls the function on each one
				of them to check if the gesture was executed.
				\\ \\
				Each gesture object has a list of data that is being compared to the live gyroscope data, to determine if a gesture was done.
				I choose to make the individual gestures specialisations of a gesture superclass.

				not exist without the VoiceAssistant. The Knowledgebase can exist independenlty of the VoiceAssitant and only exists once. Therefore the multiplicity is 1 and 1.
				\\ \\
				The sequence diagram shows the interaction between the VoiceAssistant, the WebService and the KnowledgeBase. 
				The smartwatch first tries to retreive an answer to the users question by querying the local KnowledgeBase.
				If an answer cant be found there, a WebService Object is created which qu eries a free AI search engine of the users choice for the answer.
				It then retreives the answer, saves it in the KnowledgeBase and returns it to the User. Saving to the KnowledgeBase is asynchronous,
				because there is no return value and, the sequence of actions doesnt have to wait for the completion of the operation.
