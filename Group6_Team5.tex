    \item Software Decision for Diagrams
    \item Choosing Missing Requirements
    \item Allocating Requirements
    \item Task Distribution
    \item Setting Tasks for Meeting 2
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Content of Meeting}
We used the First Meeting to discuss the foundation of our final Report. The first question was which Software are we choosing for the Diagrams to ensure a clean and consistent report. PlantUML and Magic Draw were the Software’s in discussion and after an overview of PlantUMLl by Marc we decided that Magic draw would be the best and safest option for all of us since the majority of the group already used Magic Draw or knew the Basics. Our Second To Do was to determine the other 14 requirements. After a Brainstorming session we chose the 14 requirements and allocated them between the Members.

\section*{Things to discuss}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Current Status check
    \item Presenting our results
    \item Choosing Business Value 
    \item Feedback round
    \item Setting Tasks for Meeting 3
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Content of Meeting}
Our Group used the second meeting to check how far everybody is with their Diagrams. Everyone shortly presented their already or almost finished Use Cases and the Diagrams to discuss theme within the group and to get short feedback. It was important for us to do that in the second meeting to have the possibility to optimize our other Diagrams for the best results and to avoid difficulties like too similar requirements. Furthermore, we choose the Business Values of each requirement together and it really helped us to have different opinions and takes to choose the best ones.

    \item Setting Tasks for Meeting 4
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Content of Meeting}
In our third Meeting we have once more discussed our documentation, we simply try to find a suitable format with the corresponding styling, so it looks uniform. We also distributed the time and the content which we want to present in our presentation, so that we mostly cover all our work. Finally, we had a few backlog items, which we defined in GitHub in a Project Manager table. We have discussed those like, “Intro Pitch”, or “Tabular List of all backlog items” and assigned those tasks to the group members.

			not exist without the VoiceAssistant. The Knowledgebase is can exist independenlty of the VoiceAssitant and only exists once. Therefore the multiplicity is 1 and 1.
			\\ \\
			The sequence diagram shows the interaction between the VoiceAssistant, the WebService and The KnowledgeBase. 
			The smartwatch first tries to retreive an answer to the users question by querying the local KnowledgeBase.
			If an answer cant be found there, a WebService Object is created which queries a free AI search engine of the users choice for the answer.
			It then retreives the answer, saves it in the KnowledgeBase and returns it to the User. Saving to the KnowledgeBase is asynchronous,
			because there is no return value and, the sequence of actions doesnt have to wait for the completion of the operation.

		\end{tabularx}
	\end{center}
	\paragraph{Functional requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The smartwatch should be able to display the user's current heart rate in real time when the application is active.
			\item If the heart rate doesn't return to the normal state, the user is able to call emergency. 
		\end{itemize}
		
	\paragraph{Non-functional requirements}
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The sensor must provide accurate readings within a specific tolerance e.g. +/- 2-3 heart beats per minute under nomal condition. 
			\item The app displays the heart rate within specific time frames, so delays should be minimal
		\end{itemize}

		\end{subfigure}
		\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
			The User has specific interactions for example he is able to review his heart rate on the history, he can also receive
			heart rate alerts which will include safety confirmation and extend if an emergency is needed. We can also set a limit of heart rate for example,
			if the user sets the limit to 140 bpm then he will get notified if we get passed that bpm. Next he can view the current heart rate on the smartwatch.
			The External health monioring service can sensor the heart rate proceed its data and give the user personal insight of his heartrate.

		\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
			Inside the Activity Diagram we start sensor the heart rate and proceed the data. Then with the given analysis it checks the 
			heart rate from the user. If its not fine we prepare an alert and send the user a safety confirmation. If its needed then we call an ambulance. If not 
			we can display the heartbeat data on the smartwatch. Then the user has a variety of options inside the smartwatch, e.g. 
			view current heart rate or the history of the past analysis or even receive personal insight of the heart rate.

		\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
			Inside the Class Diagram we check the data from the User because height, weight or even age does play an important factor
			for the heart rate analysis. Next we sensor the heart rate from the user and proceed the data. For that we use a directional 
			association since we do the operation once, and the muliplitiy stays 1 because we only use 1 sensor. Inside the process data we check for 
			the current heart rate. Last but not least, we display the data and the user is able to show the completed heart rate 
			analysis.

			Inside the Main we get the profile from the user and read the heartRate with the Sensor. Next we proceed the data and check

			the data and prepare to display the data to the user. When we send the data to the user we also make sure to stop the sensoring and 
			the user is able to review the current heart rate analysis.

		\end{tabularx}

		\end{itemize}
		
	\paragraph{Non-functional requirements}

			The Environment Monitoring shows the use cases. The Actvity sensor sensors the environment and transmit
			proceeds the data and generate a safe monioring notification. This tells the user the current environement e.g.
			temperature, UV exposure or more. If it comes to hazardous conditions it sends the user a notification and asks him 
			to either acknoweldege or not. Next the activity sensor displays the data on the smartwatch and record or
			track any other incident reports. The user on the other hand can acknoweldege the notification and look into
			history data and has an authentification.

		\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
			The activity diagram shows a walkthrough of the operations or activities that need to be done, 
			so it can monitor the environment. Firstly, it activates the sensor and collects all the environment 
			data and transmits/proceeds them. It later asks for safe monitoring to ensure that there are no incidents 
			like hazards or natural disasters. If the user clicks no then the system prepares the notification and 
			asks the user to acknowledge the alert. The alert shows tips or recommendations which need to be done, to 
			shorten the risk of endangering personal life. If the user doesn’t accept the notification then the system 
			keeps warning the user or keeps spamming alerts, else it displays the data with the notification.

		\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
			The UML shows the structure of the classes, how they interact with each other and what methods are 
			used later in the sequence diagram. For example, the Activity Sensor sends data to the process data 
			which is a unidirectional relation with 1. The activity sensor has methods like activate sensor, keep 
			monitoring and stop monitoring. The monitoring would work permanently while the smartwatch is on. The 
			process list has the notifications, hazardous condition and process data and uses the unidirectional 
			relation to the display. While the display formats the data to the smartwatch so that the user can access 
			the data and can see the outputted data.

		\begin{subfigure}{\textwidth}
			The sensor diagram almost works the same way as the display heartbeat data. It activates the sensor, 
			does the process and checks for hazardous conditions in the environment and does the following alternative
			operations. Later it either sends a notification or outputs the data to the display of the smartwatch. 
			The small part of smartwatch on represents that the sensor works permanently and keeps monitoring until 
			the smartwatch is off.
